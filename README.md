Counting Tours on a Grid Problem:

If T(x,y) is the number of tours over an X * Y grid...
      The tour starts in the top left square
      The tour cosists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one square
      The tour visits each square exactly once
      The tour ends in the bottom left square
      
      
Ex output: 
    T(2,2) = 1, T(3,3) = 2, T(4,3) = 0, and T(3,4) = 4
